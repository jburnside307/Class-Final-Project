# Network-Engagement-Project
For this project, we applied the knowledge and tools to work as Network Analysts to scan and observe the traffic going in and out of the network. In using Wireshark and Netminer, we identified what was happening during business hours. After collecting the data, we were able to pinpoint the differences between normal and malicious traffic on display, and present our results.
